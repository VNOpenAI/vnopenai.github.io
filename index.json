[{"categories":["News"],"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve just released Open Control - a python package that implements basic algorithms for analysis and design of optimal feedback controllers.\nFeatures:   Classical control methods\n  Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) computation\n  Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) for optimal linear/nonlinear control systems\n  Off-policy, On-policy learning algorithms for linear/nonlinear systems\n  Experience replay algorithms for linear/nonlinear systems (TODO)\n  Learn Reinforcement Learning by the tutorial notebook and examples code.\n  OpenControl provides algorithms for wide range of system dynamics, including classical control module and reinforcement learning control systems with ADP module. For learning purpose, we recommend starting with our example code to define a system and run the simulation.\nDevelopment You can check out the latest version of our source code by cloning the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/VNOpenAI/OpenControl` Installation Before all, create a new virtual conda environment and install requirements\npip install requirements.txt You can do minimal installation of OpenControl with\npip install OpenControl Check version\npython \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import OpenControl \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; OpenControl.__version__ Documentation Please read the lastest version of our documentation here\nHow to contact OpenControl team?
